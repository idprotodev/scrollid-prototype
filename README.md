# ScrollID Token (SID)

> üß™ A fully functional prototype for identity-token UX exploration using the ENS domain `scrollid.eth`.

---

## üîç Overview

**ScrollID Token (SID)** is an experimental ERC-20 token and identity UX demo centered around the ENS name `scrollid.eth`.  
It explores wallet binding, identity resolution, and claim interactions designed for the Scroll L2 ecosystem or any identity-aware infrastructure on-chain.

This prototype is a complete proof-of-concept (PoC), combining:
- ERC-20 smart contract (`ScrollIDToken.sol`)
- React-based UI with ENS name resolution
- ENS-linked identity (`you.scrollid.eth`)
- Simulated token claim process

## üí° Use Case Highlights

1. **Verified Wallet‚ÄìENS Linking**  
   Connect wallet addresses to identities like `alice.scrollid.eth` and simulate verified binding.

2. **ZK-Ready Attestation Anchors**  
   Use SID as a mock anchor for zk identity attestations or delegated rights.

3. **ENS-Based Login UX**  
   Demonstrates how ENS + MetaMask integration creates secure, human-readable login flows.

4. **Session or Role Tokens**  
   Model short-term token issuance for roles, delegation, or identity-gated applications.

## üß™ Live Demo & Identity Domain

- üîó ENS: [`scrollid.eth`](https://app.ens.domains/name/scrollid.eth)
- üíª Demo UI: [https://scrollid-ui.netlify.app](https://scrollid-ui.netlify.app)
- üß¨ GitHub: [github.com/your-org/scrollid-prototype](https://github.com/your-org/scrollid-prototype)

> ‚úÖ This prototype is fully tied to the ENS domain `scrollid.eth`.  
> Without ownership of this name, this identity resolution flow cannot be replicated.  
> The ENS text records include contact, GitHub, and demo URLs for verification.
