# ScrollID Token (SID)

> 🧪 Experimental prototype for identity-token UX design in the Scroll ecosystem.

---

## 🔍 Overview

**ScrollID Token (SID)** is a functional proof-of-concept for identity-layer UX within the Scroll ecosystem. Built around the reserved ENS domain `scrollid.eth`, this project demonstrates how decentralized identity anchoring, wallet binding, and token-based claims can be deployed in Scroll-native applications.

This project is **not affiliated** with Scroll or any official entity. It exists to highlight future integration opportunities for identity frameworks within the Scroll ecosystem.

## 💡 Potential Use Cases

- **Verified Wallet ID Binding**  
  Enable unique user identification through ENS-based wallet linkage, e.g., `user.scrollid.eth`.

- **zkLogin & Session Management**  
  Prepare for future identity protocols including zero-knowledge login, delegated sessions, or anonymous credentials.

- **Scroll Passport & Credential Anchoring**  
  Act as a potential component in a future Scroll-native Passport or identity credential layer.
